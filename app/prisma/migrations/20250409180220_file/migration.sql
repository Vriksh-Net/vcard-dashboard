/*
  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `User` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `User` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Account` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Session` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `TeamMember` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Made the column `name` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Made the column `email` on table `User` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `VCard` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
